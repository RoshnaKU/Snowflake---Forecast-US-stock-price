As part of my learning journey, I have worked on this project based on the article : https://medium.com/snowflake/facebook-prophet-forecasts-running-in-snowflake-with-snowpark-14fc870b56ae
This article explains usage of Snowpark and Facebook Prophet in Snowflake to predict currency exchange rates whereas I have used Knoema Economy Data Atlas dataset from Snowflake Marketplace to predict US stock prices for Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Meta.

## Introduction

Forecasting stock prices is a critical task for investors, traders, and financial analysts. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for forecasting US stock prices using the Facebook Prophet time series forecasting model in Snowpark, leveraging the power of Snowflake's data processing capabilities and the Knoema Economy Data Atlas dataset available from the Snowflake Marketplace.

The integration of Facebook Prophet with Snowpark and the Knoema dataset enables users to easily access and analyze historical stock price data, generate accurate forecasts, and make informed investment decisions.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following prerequisites:

1. *Snowflake account*: You need access to a Snowflake account to use Snowpark and access the Snowflake Marketplace.
2. *Knoema Economy Data Atlas dataset*: Access the Knoema Economy Data Atlas dataset from the Snowflake Marketplace. This dataset provides historical stock price data and other relevant economic indicators.
